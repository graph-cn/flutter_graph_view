# Flutter Graph View - Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of **Flutter Graph View**, a powerful Dart/Flutter library for creating interactive and animated graph visualizations.

Flutter Graph View makes it easy to visualize complex network relationships, organizational hierarchies, dependency graphs, knowledge bases, and other graph-based data structures with a smooth, responsive user experience.

## 📚 Main Topics

### Getting Started
- [Overview](overview.md) — Learn what Flutter Graph View is, its core concepts, and main features
- [Quick Start](quick_start.md) — Set up and create your first interactive graph in minutes

### Core Architecture
- [Data Models](models.md) — Understand the fundamental data structures: Graph, Vertex, and Edge
- [Data Converters](convertors.md) — Transform your business data into graph structures recognized by the library
- [Layout Algorithms](algorithms.md) — Explore algorithms for computing node positions in 2D space (force-directed, circle, random, etc.)

### Styling and Customization
- [Styles and Colors](styles.md) — Configure vertex colors, shapes, edge appearances, and visual themes
- [Text Rendering](text_rendering.md) — Customize how labels and text are rendered on nodes and edges

### Algorithm Extensions
- [Decorators](decorators.md) — Extend algorithm behaviors modularly using the decorator pattern (forces, persistence, pause control, etc.)

### User Interaction
- [Graph Options](options.md) — Configure interactivity, event handlers, panels, zoom/pan, and visual behaviors

### Advanced Features
- [Dashboard and Overlays](dashboard.md) — Create floating data panels, controls, and custom UI overlays
- [Extensions](extensions.md) — Use built-in extensions or create custom ones to add specialized functionality
